# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- Renamed: `RDPPreflightClient` is now `RDPSessionClient`,
  `RDPPreflightReport` is `RDPConnectionReport`, `RDPPreflightError` is
  `RDPConnectionError`, `RDPProbeWarning` is `RDPConnectionWarning` and
  `RDPLatestFrameDecodeQueue` is `RDPFrameDecodeQueue`.
- `RDPVideoToolboxFrameDecoder` and `RDPVideoDecodeError` replace the H.264
  and HEVC frame decoders and their errors. `RDPH264NALUnit`,
  `RDPHEVCNALUnit` and `nalUnits(from:)` are removed.
- `RDPFrameDecodeQueue` decodes every frame in order through `submitAndWait`.
  `submit`, `submitReportingCompletion`, the queue-depth parameters,
  `onSkippedFrames` and the dropped-frame completion and error are removed.
  Composed presentations carry their pixels in `imageBuffer`, not
  `decodedBitmapData`.
- `RDPGraphicsFrameSnapshot`:
  - New content kinds `.surfaceCopy` and `.alpha`, plus `deletedSurfaceIDs`
    and `evictedCacheSlots`. `RDPFrameDecodeQueue` applies them; a client
    that decodes snapshots itself must too, or it shows stale pixels.
  - Bitmap snapshots of a surface mapped to scaled output carry the unscaled
    surface, as video snapshots do; `mappedOutputRect` says where it goes.
  - The `h264*` aliases are removed; use `encodedVideoData`,
    `videoByteCount` and `videoNalUnitTypes`.
- `RDPConnectionReport` drops `tlsCipherSuite`, the message hex lists and the
  clipboard and input probe fields, which moved into the `RDPPreflight` tool.
  `stage` splits `tls-upgrade` into `tls-handshake`, `credssp` and
  `early-user-authorization`. `RDPGFXMessageSummary` drops its per-command
  detail fields.
- `RDPRenderMetrics` drops the crop timings, the skipped-frame count and the
  per-stage maximums except `maxDecodeMilliseconds`.
- `RDPInputStateTracker.keyboard(scancode:isReleased:)` drops `isRepeat` and
  `trackRelease`; use `releasePressedInputs()` to release everything held.
- Clipboard: `requestRemoteFileSize` and `requestRemoteFileRange` drop
  `clipDataID`, and `RDPClipboardFileDescriptorW` drops its creation and
  last-access times.
- A throwing `onGraphicsFrame` ends the session with
  `RDPConnectionError.graphicsFrameHandler`. Error cases that were never
  thrown are removed.
- `RDPConnectionIdentity.credentialAccountName` lowercases the host, so
  passwords saved under the old name need moving; RDPClient does this.
- `RDPFramePacingState`, `RDPFramePresentationBuffer`,
  `cropToDestinationRect` and `decodeReportFirstFrame(_:)` moved into the
  examples.
- The default client, workstation and source names are `RDPKit`/`RDPKIT`.

### Compatibility and fixes

- Connections: every step before the first frame is bounded by the timeout,
  with TCP keepalive. Sessions survive Deactivate All reactivation and server
  redirection, and end with a proper disconnect, so servers log a logoff
  instead of a network failure.
- Errors: lost connections, DNS failures
  (`RDPConnectionError.addressResolution`), licensing failures and logon
  failures such as `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE` now report a clear reason.
- Video:
  - Windows text drawn over video is no longer dropped.
  - gnome-remote-desktop's partial video updates and scrolls no longer turn
    black.
  - AVC444 from Windows and FreeRDP 3 decodes correctly, and H.264 colours
    are right on every tested server, including KRdp's.
  - `RDPVideoToolboxFrameDecoder.decode(_:)` returns only the visible frame;
    `RDPDecodedFramePresentation.imageBuffer` can be larger than the frame.
  - After video fails to decode, for example once iOS invalidates the
    decoder in the background, its surface keeps its last picture until a
    keyframe instead of decoding updates without their reference, failing
    them as the new `RDPVideoDecodeError.awaitingKeyframe`. Windows sends a
    keyframe when the client sends its monitor layout again.
- Other graphics: fixes for RemoteFX, RemoteFX Progressive, ClearCodec,
  NSCodec, planar and legacy bitmaps, and pointers. Deleted surfaces free
  their decoders. Every frame is acknowledged, even ones that fail to decode.
- Input and display: `RDPInputSession` and `RDPDisplayControlSession` stop
  sending once the server deactivates or replaces them, and `onInputReady`
  and `onDisplayControlReady` hand out new ones. `onDisplayControlReady` runs
  after the first frame, because KRdp ignores earlier layouts. New
  `RDPScrollWheelAccumulator` turns scroll deltas into wheel events.
- Clipboard: text goes out with CRLF line ends and arrives with LF. Remote
  file names are valid and unique, and malformed requests get an error reply.
- Audio: only PCM rates `AVAudioEngine` can play are negotiated, and
  `RDPAudioPlayer` resumes after an interruption.
- Unsupported dynamic channels are declined instead of accepted, and
  mid-session auto-detect requests are answered.

### Security

- Cancelling from `onCertificate` rejects the server before any credential is
  sent, and `shouldCancel` is honoured throughout connecting. The full
  certificate chain is evaluated, and `RDPServerCertificateInfo.host` names
  the host it was checked against.
- Server-controlled sizes and counts are bounded, so a hostile server can't
  exhaust memory or time, and malformed data throws instead of crashing.
- `RDPWireTranscript` zeroes redirection passwords and auto-reconnect
  cookies, and takes a `maximumPayloadByteCount`.

### Performance

- RemoteFX decodes about 20% faster, and planar, interleaved and ClearCodec
  bitmaps 3 to 30 times faster. Partial 4K video updates take about a quarter
  of the time.

### Examples

- RDPClient asks before trusting an unknown server certificate and refuses a
  changed one. It also fixes keyboard modifiers, Windows-key and keypad
  input, clipboard file downloads and display resize after a redirection.
  When video fails to decode, it keeps the session and asks the server for a
  fresh picture.

## 0.3.1

  Mac Catalyst. The macOS 13.0 and visionOS 1.0 minimums are unchanged.

## 0.3.0

- Follow server redirections, including routing tokens and connect-time
  bandwidth detection.
- Improve Windows and KRdp compatibility across licensing, activation,
  dynamic channels, remote termination and reconnects.
- Add a persistent RDPGFX compositor: mapped and scaled surfaces, partial and
  multi-surface updates, caches, fills, alpha and graphics resets.
- Add RemoteFX Progressive, classic RemoteFX, ClearCodec, NSCodec, RDP 6.0
  bitmap and Interleaved RLE decoding.
- Add AVC444 and AVC444v2 decoding, with a Metal reconstruction path.
- Improve H.264 presentation with zero-copy CoreVideo frames and
  acknowledgements sent only after a frame is shown.
- Negotiate RDPGFX versions 8.0 through 10.7.
- Add remote pointer shapes and fast-path keyboard, Unicode, pointer and
  wheel input.
